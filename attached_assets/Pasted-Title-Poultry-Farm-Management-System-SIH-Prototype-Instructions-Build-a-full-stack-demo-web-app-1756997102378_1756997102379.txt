Title: Poultry Farm Management System – SIH Prototype

Instructions:
Build a full-stack demo web application named "Poultry Farm Management System" using Python (Flask or FastAPI) for backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or React) for frontend.

Features to Implement:

Dashboard: Show farm score, applicable government schemes, daily tasks, and farm summary in a visually appealing way (use charts and progress bars).

Gamification: Create a points/rewards system for farmers when they complete daily biosecurity tasks. Show badges or levels.

Farm Health Monitor: Section showing if proper sanitation is done, with red/yellow/green indicators.

Revenue & Expenses: Simple ledger to add revenue & expenses and auto-calculate profit/loss.

Future Benefits Section: Display motivational messages & projected growth graphs based on completed tasks.

AI Training Module: Provide a multilingual training page (English + Hindi) with simple text or video placeholders.

Nearby Alerts: Show nearest veterinary contact and send alert if farm temperature exceeds safe level.

Business Chat: A basic chat interface where farmers can connect with suppliers (dummy chat works for demo).

Disease Solutions: A searchable list of common poultry diseases with solutions.

Temperature/Flu Alerts: AI-based (simulate with dummy data) that warns farmers when temperature is abnormal or flu risk is detected.

Farm Visit Tracking: Generate a QR code and a simple counter to log farm visitors (simulate counter updates).

Technical Stack:

Backend: Python (Flask or FastAPI)

Frontend: React (preferred) or Vanilla JS + Bootstrap for responsive UI

Database: SQLite for storing tasks, revenue/expense, user data

Libraries:

Chart.js or Recharts for dashboard visualization

Flask-SQLAlchemy (ORM)

qrcode for QR code generation

geopy for nearest veterinary location (mock data acceptable for demo)

Requirements:

Make UI clean and farmer-friendly (large buttons, minimal text).

Use mock data where real data is not available.

Comment code properly so that anyone can understand.

Keep code modular so we can later integrate IoT data or real APIs.

Deployable as a single-page demo on Replit.
